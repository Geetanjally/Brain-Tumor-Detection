# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify brain MRI images into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor.

The model was trained using a labeled dataset of MRI images organized into separate folders for each tumor type. TensorFlowâ€™s tf.data pipeline was used to efficiently load, normalize, and batch the images during training. The CNN learns directly from the image data, without using any pre-trained weights or transfer learning.

The trained model can predict the type of tumor present in new MRI images, assisting in early detection and diagnosis.
